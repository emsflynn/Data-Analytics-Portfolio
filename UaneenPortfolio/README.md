# **Uaneen Award - Portfolio about Trombone skills and experiences**




DCU offered a 'Uaneen Award' as a module for final year students that had a strong committment to their extra-curricular activities. 
I took this module as I have an extensive range of experience playing the trombone. 
In this portfolio is all about my music journey.
